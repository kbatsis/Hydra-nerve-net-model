This project concerns an integrate-and-fire based model of the Hydra species nerve net, developed as part of my master thesis. Its purpose is to explore a proposed self-organized mechanism for the periodic contractions these animals exhibit. The model was constructed with Anaconda Python 2.7 and the Brian 2 neural simulator. This version of the code runs 400 simulations of the model over different parameter values and returns metrics related to the contractile behavior, saved to an excel file. Functions for examining raster plot outputs, visualizing the network, running a FFT analysis etc. are included.
